# Project 1 (GA) 
Is to demonstrate the past three weeks lessons into a viable interactive project.

# Trivia 
A simple one page quiz on 1980s pop culture. User selects answer and submits it in box (form) and is alerted on being
correct or wrong. User score will also be displayed. 

# Explanations of Technologies Used
jQuery language: 
Submit input will aceept user answer and is attached to form element to allow use of ENTER/Return key. 
Prevent default stops page from refreshing and is added to each element to prevent further refresh and answers submitted more than once.

# Unsolved Problems
Alert pops up before span "Processing.." text. Will have to figure out how jQuery 'timeout' may delay alerts.

# Future Enhancements for Trivia
Move scoreboard to the left or right and have as fixed position when scrolling or show score at end/popup.
Add a restart button.
Get rid of hard code. Have questions in a JS array instead.
Get rid of submit form and have button options available instead. 
Have questions displayed one at a time and then score at end.
